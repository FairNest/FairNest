# FairNest
Finding roommates is already hard — but living with them? Even harder. From unpaid bills and unwashed dishes to clashing lifestyles and poor communication, living together often turns into a silent war of passive-aggressive post-its and emotional burnout. FairNest is built to fix that.

We’re a smart roommate management system designed to make co-living fair, transparent, and harmonious — from the moment you match to how you manage chores, finances, and compatibility. With built-in accountability tools, lifestyle alignment insights, and streamlined task coordination, FairNest transforms shared living from chaotic to collaborative.
Because a shared space shouldn't come at the cost of your peace.
